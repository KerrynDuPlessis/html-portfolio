<hr />

<h3>When Marnie Was There</h3>
<p>

Release Date: 19 July 2014<br />
</p>
<h4>Synopsis:</h4>
<p>A distressed girl is compelled to live in the countryside by her foster parents. There, she befriends Marnie, a mysterious girl, who helps her confront the truth about her identity.</p>
<h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
<p>This is one of my all time favorite Ghibli films. It is simple and heartfelt. I am a fan of slice of life so it fits well into that niche.</p>

<h3>The Princess and the Frog</h3>
<p>
Studio: Walt Disney Pictures<br />
Release Date: 25 November 2009<br />
</p>
<h4>Synopsis:</h4>
<p>A young waitress, Tiana, embarks on a hilarious adventure after her fateful kiss with a frog prince who cannot wait to be human again.</p>
<h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
<p>One of my all time favorite Disney films. It holds a special place in my heart as it is the last feature film that Disney produced using their signiture hand drawn style. This was the last film produced with their traditional animation department before it was shut down. I have always been and always will be a huge fan of original Disney animation with the hand drawn aesthetic.</p>

<h3>Klaus</h3>
<p>
Studio: The SPA Studios<br />
Release Date: 8 November 2019<br />
</p>
<h4>Synopsis:</h4>
<p>After proving himself to be the worst student at the academy, a postman is sent to a frozen town in the North where he discovers a reclusive toymaker named Klaus.</p>
<h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
<p>This particular film is not one from a Genre I particularly enjoy. I am not one for Christmas movies and have never been one to watch them. However, this film is stunningly animated. The style is breathtaking and really something that I find visually stunning. The storyline is also very fun and enjoyable to watch and thus is why it is in this list.</p>
